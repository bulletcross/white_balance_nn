# White Balance (Illuminant Estimation) Using Convolutional Neural Network
This is the project I am currently working on as an undergrad research assistant under the supervision of professor [Peter Van Beek](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~vanbeek/). The project fucoses on Color Constancy. The goal is to estimate illumination of a scene to correct the extrinsic bias induced by illuminant based on the observed color of an image.
Professor had good performance on the problem using decision tree. We hope to try CNN and compare the result with our model.

Currently I am trying to reimplement the algorithm introduced in [Deep Specialized Network for Illuminant Estimation](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/files/eccv_2016_illuminant.pdf).
